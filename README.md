**Road Map App** *Kotlin*

This is the very basic version of a mobile app that helps visualize tasks to be completed on the day. 
The looks of the layout have yet to be implemented, and more detailed features have yet to be added, but the code is scalable and the app can be extended on this basis easily.

It's written in Kotlin, and uses the MVVM architecture.
